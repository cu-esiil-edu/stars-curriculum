# ESIIL STARS brings Earth Data Science skills to small minority-serving institutions

The STARS program is 6 months long. In the first phase, Spring Training, students and facultymlearn 
Earth Data Science skills using the project-based and culturally relevant notebooks in this repository.
In the second phase, students complete self-directed projects under the direction of their faculty.
Students are expected to further utilize and expand their Earth Data Science skillset through the project.
This repository contains student and solution versions of the curriculum used in the Spring Training phase.
In each notebook, students are invited to reproduce the analysis at a time and place that is meaningful
to them.

A goal for the STARS curriculum is to present culturally relevant topics in Earth Data Science to the
Tribal- and Hispanic-serving colleges participating in the program. We hope to improve this aspect
over time with the help and feedback of the STARS students and faculty, and also with the input
of Indigenous scientists and liasons working with ESIIL. We invite any feedback through Issues
submitted in this repository, or via email to Dr. Elsa Culler at `elsa <dot> culler <at> colorado <dot> edu`.

## Notebook 1: Getting Started with Reproducible Science

This notebook introduces the Python programming language as well as best practices for style and documentation.
Students complete an analysis of maximum daily average temperatures in Rapid City, South Dakota using
data from the [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/).
Students are asked to reflect on any changes they see in the magnitude and variability over time, and 
what role climate change might play.

Many of the STARS students and faculty live near Rapid City, and have experienced the increasingly severe
extreme temperatures in recent years. For those who are not nearby, the have the opportunity to reproduce 
their analysis in a more relevent or meaningful location.

## Notebook 2: Time Series Data

Students complete an analysis of a recent flooding event on the Cheyenne River in South Dakota
using streamflow data from the [USGS National Water Information System](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis?). This
same flooding event occurred throughout the Midwestern United States, and affected many of the students 
and faculty in the STARS program. In addition, some participants have historical ties to the area and
were able to add pieces of family history to their interactive maps and analysis if they wished.
Again, students repeated the analysis for a different flooding event of their choice. Students are
encouraged to pick flooding events that they themselves experienced or that they could incorporate oral
history into the analysis, if they wished.

## Notebook 3: Spatial Data

Using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data from the MODIS sensor, students complete an analysis
of irrigated agriculture over time on the Gila River Reservation in Arizona. The Gila River Community
won a lawsuit in 2004 that returned significant senior water rights to the tribes in the area. Though
no STARS participants have ties ot the Gila River Community, water rights for Indigenous communities
in the Southwest is currently being negotiated by other Tribes and has great implications for health 
and cultural preservation. In the Gila River Reservation, NDVI increases in the years after the settlement,
suggesting that irrigated agriculture is resuming in the area after over a century of hiatus.
Students are encouraged to repeat this analysis in an area of their choosing that has experienced
a change, whether due to a natural disaster or human activities.
